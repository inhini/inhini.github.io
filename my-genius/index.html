            <p>Sesame is my lovely lovely cat who I would unironically give up my life for.</p>
            <p>Sesame's Chinese name is Tangyuan, a Chinese glutinous rice ball dessert similar to mochi, which is often filled with black sesame paste! We thought it was perfect because he's black, grey and white, and when he was a kitten he was tiny and
                soft like tangyuan.</p>
            <p>This is what tangyuan (the dessert) looks like:</p>
